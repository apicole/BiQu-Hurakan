Please find in this Repo, the information relevant to BiQu Hurakan.

1- you cna putty to your Hurakan with biqu:biqu as much as with root:root

2- H2 extruder install needs some tweaking in the file generic-bigtreetech-hurakan-m4p.cfg, this is the one shared here.

3- I have set mAcros to reflect the temperature, both in screen and hotend_rgb - see printer.cfg file
